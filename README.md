## How to use

PocketBaseUML is a web application that runs in your browser.  
You can access it online at [pocketbase-uml.github.io](https://pocketbase-uml.github.io) or run it locally on your computer with:

```sh
npx pocketbase-uml@latest
```

You can build your Docker Image using our Dockerfile:

1- First, you can build the image using this command:

```sh
docker build -t pocket-app .
```

2- Run the Docker container:

```sh
docker run -d -p <PortOnYourChoise>:9000 pocket-app
```

3- Browse the application via: http://localhost:`ThePortThatYouHaveChosen`

Due to security browser restrictions, the online application can only access PocketBase databases through HTTPS.  
If you want to access a local PocketBase databases through HTTP, you can either run the application locally or use a service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your local server to the Internet.
